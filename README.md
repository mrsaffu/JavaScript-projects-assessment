# 📂 JavaScript Projects Assessment

Welcome to the **JavaScript Projects Assessment** repository!  
This repository contains practical projects focused on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **working with APIs** to build interactive web applications using vanilla JavaScript.

Each project is designed to help you strengthen your understanding of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling user input, and fetching/displaying data dynamically.
